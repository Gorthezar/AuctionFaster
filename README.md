# AuctionFaster installation

This addon needs to be placed in in `Interface\Addons\AuctionFaster`

## Using git:
```
git clone https://github.com/kaminaris/AuctionFaster.git --recursive
```

## Downloading zip:

This one will be harder. 

1. First download zip of whole addon:  
https://github.com/kaminaris/AuctionFaster/archive/master.zip  
    1. Extract it **directly** (not to subfolder). Change folder name from `AuctionFaster-master` to `AuctionFaster`

2. Download library zip:  
https://github.com/kaminaris/StdUi/archive/master.zip  
    1. Extract it **directly** (not to subfolder). Change folder name from `StdUi-master` to `StdUi`  
    2. Move entire StdUi folder to `AuctionFaster\Libs`
